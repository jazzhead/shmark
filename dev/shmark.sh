# This is just a wrapper script that sources the shmark.sh functions so that
# those functions can be tested without having to source them into the shell
# environment. The wrapper script also allows stricter testing by setting extra
# options such as 'nounset' and 'errexit'. NOTE: Tests should be run both with
# and without the 'errexit' and other options set above. Run with the options
# set when writing and testing the functions. Then comment the options out to
# simulate the way the functions are likely to be run when sourced into the
# shell environment.
#
# NOTE: Shell scripts like this can't change directories for a shell, so to
# fully test any functions that change directories, the functions file will
# need to be sourced into the shell environment and tested directly from the
# shell instead of this wrapper script.
